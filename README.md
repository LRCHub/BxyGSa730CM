[00:05.84] I wanna write you a song
[00:10.29] One as beautiful as you are sweet
[00:14.77] Just a hint of pain for the feeling
[00:18.08] That I get when you are gone
[00:21.78] I wanna write you a song
[00:33.78] 
[00:26.30] I wanna lend you my coat
[00:30.73] One that's as soft as your cheek
[00:35.07] So when the world is cold
[00:37.27] You will have a hiding place you can go
[00:41.96] I wanna lend you my coat
[00:53.96] 
[00:46.61] Oooh
[00:48.94] Everything I need I get from you
[00:55.72] Oooh, ooh
[00:57.97] You give it back 'cause I want it too
[01:16.47] 
[01:04.81] I wanna build you a boat
[01:09.26] One as strong as you are free
[01:13.59] So anytime you think that your heart is gonna sink
[01:17.54] You know it won't
[01:20.60] I wanna build you a boat
[01:32.60] 
[01:25.25] Oooh
[01:27.36] Everything I need I get from you
[01:34.01] Oooh, ooh
[01:36.48] Giving back is all I wanna do
[01:41.17] Oooh
[01:43.17] 
[02:03.69] Oooh
[02:05.81] Everything I need I get from you
[02:12.40] Oooh, ooh
[02:14.92] Giving back is all I wanna do
[02:29.42] 
[02:23.09] I wanna write you a song
[02:27.36] One to make your heart remember me
[02:31.52] So anytime I'm gone you can listen to my voice and sing along
[02:38.63] I wanna write you a song
