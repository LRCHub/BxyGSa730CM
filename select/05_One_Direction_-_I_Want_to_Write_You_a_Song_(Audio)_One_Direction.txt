I want to write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I want to write you a song

I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You will have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

Ooh
Everything I need, I get from you
Ooh
And giving back is all I wanna do

I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think
That your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't
I wanna build you a boat

Ooh
Everything I need, I get from you
Ooh
And giving back is all I wanna do
Ooh

Ooh
Everything I need, I get from you
Ooh
Giving back is all I wanna do
Ooh

I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So anytime I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song
